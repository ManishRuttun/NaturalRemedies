        <p>A headache affects almost everyone at some point in their lives. For many people, headaches are infrequent and merely inconvenient. Headaches, on the other hand, can be a terrible and lifelong health problem for certain people. We'll look at different sorts of headaches and what you may do to relieve the pain in this article.</p>


        <h2>Common types of headaches</h2>
        <p>Headaches come in a variety of forms. The more you know about the type that affects you, the better you'll be able to avoid and manage its causes and symptoms. Three of the most common types are listed below.</p>


        <h2>Tension headaches</h2>
        <p>These are the most common headaches, and they can affect anyone. Tension headaches are classified as chronic if they linger for several hours and occur more than 15 times a month.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> A stress headache is characterized by a dull, non-throbbing discomfort. You may feel as if you're wearing an extremely tight headband around your head; the pain is felt all over your head, not just in one spot.</li>
          <li><strong>Causes:</strong> While the exact reason is unknown, a tension headache can be caused by a variety of circumstances, including stress, prolonged loud noises, dehydration, poor sleep, and skipping meals, to name a few.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Cluster headaches</h2>
        <p>Cluster headaches are one of the most excruciating types of headaches. Clusters, as the name implies, occur in a pattern or cluster lasting weeks or months. You may get many headaches each day during a cluster period, lasting anything from 15 minutes to several hours. Cluster headache sufferers may experience periods of remission, in which their symptoms disappear for months or years.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Cluster headaches are severe headaches that occur behind or around one eye. It's also possible that your eye could appear red and teary. On that side of your head, you may also have a stuffy nose and perspiration, and your face may appear red.</li>
          <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Cluster headaches, like other types of headaches, have no identified etiology. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to acquire them, and smoking and drinking can exacerbate the pain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Migraine</h2>
        <p>Migraines are headaches that occur frequently, are painful, and last a long time. Some people have migraines on a monthly basis, while others only get them once or twice a year. A migraine may last a few hours for some people. It could take up to three days for others.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> You may experience mood swings, neck stiffness, lights or spots in your field of vision, and even difficulties speaking up to 48 hours before a migraine. A migraine headache is characterized by a throbbing or pulsing pain on one side of the brain. You may have nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound during this time.</li>
          <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Migraines appear to be inherited; if a member of your family suffers from migraines, you are three times more likely to suffer from them as well. Women are three times as likely than men to suffer from migraines.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Other types of headaches</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sinus headaches.</strong> They cause discomfort in the front of your head, particularly your cheekbones and the bridge of your nose, and are frequently misdiagnosed as migraines. You may also experience a runny nose, fever, and facial puffiness.
Allergies, a sinus infection, or a virus that affects your upper respiratory system can trigger sinus headaches.</li>
          <li><strong>Exertional headaches.</strong> These are throbbing headaches that normally last a few hours but can linger up to two days. They are brought on by strenuous physical activity such as sprinting, leaping, or lifting weights.</li>
          <li><strong>Hormone headaches.</strong> During menstrual periods, pregnancy, menopause, or hormone replacement therapy, some women get migraine-like headaches as their hormone levels fluctuate.</li>
          <li><strong>Medical overuse headaches</strong> These headaches, also known as "rebound" headaches, are similar to tension headaches and occur in some persons who take painkillers for more than 15 days in a month.</li>
          <li><strong>Caffeine headaches.</strong> These resemble migraines and are caused by either drinking too much caffeine (coffee, soda, or energy drinks) or not drinking caffeine at all if you are used to it.</li>
        </ul>
