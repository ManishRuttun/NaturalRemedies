        <h3>People who practice mindful movement feel better, are happier and have more energy in their lives.</h3>

        <p>If your workout is merely another item on your "to-do" list, you may not be receiving the full range of health advantages. Mindful movement, in which you are deliberately in the present and aware of every action you make, works both your body and mind. You can not only gain physically by exercising, but you can also:</p>

        <div class="yoga">
          <ul>
            <li>reduce stress, anxiety and depression and boost mood</li>
            <li>improve your overall well-being</li>
            <li>increase your awareness of your body and its signals</li>
            <li>improve cognition, including concentration, problem solving and memory</li>
            <li>improve your sleep</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>These advantages do not end with the workout. It becomes simpler to include mindfulness throughout your day as you improve at mindfulness throughout your workout. People who practice mindful movement feel better, are happier, and have more energy as they go about their everyday tasks, according to studies. Some people claim to be able to deal with life's hardships more calmly.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Yoga and Tai Chi</h2>
        <p>Mindfulness is included into some activities, such as yoga and tai chi ch'uan. Yoga began as a form of movement to seek enlightenment thousands of years ago. There was no distinction made between the mind and the body, and meditation was constantly a part of the routine.</p>
        <p>Tai chi is a Chinese movement exercise that blends breathing and visualization with movement to engage the full body. It is based on an old martial technique. Tai chi has been shown to increase longevity and reduce the symptoms of arthritis, chronic lung disease, fibromyalgia, and other chronic illnesses, according to certain studies.</p>

        <h2>Practice mindfulness during workout</h2>
        <p>If you already have a preferred workout regimen, try adding mindfulness to it the next time you go. If you're a weight lifter, for example, don't say to yourself, "I'm done after ten more reps." Instead, focus on your breathing while you lift and lower the weight to stay in the moment. Pay attention to how the muscle feels as it flexes and then extends. You will feel more calm as you practice this thoughtful approach of lifting weights. Consider it similar to learning to drive a car without using the parking brake. The automobile moves more effortlessly and smoothly. As you lessen the base level tension that has built up through time, you will move more fluidly and freely, and your body will be more efficient over time.</p>

        <h2>Mindful movement is for everyone</h2>
        <p>Regardless of age or ability, anyone may learn to exercise more thoughtfully. Yoga and tai chi are examples of mindful activities that can be tailored to your abilities. Even individuals who are unable to move, such as those who are bedridden, can benefit from mindfulness by performing the task with their minds. Even envisioning movements has been shown to have physical and mental advantages in studies.</p>
