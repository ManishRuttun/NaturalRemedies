          <p class="text"><strong>Castor oil</strong>, in the science world also known as Ricinus cimmunis, is a vegetable oil that comes from squeezing castor seeds. It's a natural ingredient that helps you fight off dry skin.</p>
          <p class="text">Castor oil includes ricinoleic acid, which has numerous health benefits.</p>
          <p class="text">It can be used to treat inflammatory skin, sunburns, acne, and even scars. The oil penetrates the scar tissue and promotes the formation of healthy cells in the surrounding area. You must utilize the method on a regular basis for it to work.</p>
